        Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
        Please, take the time to show us some code and/or config that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.

        Optional: only if you have suggestions on a fix/reason for the bug
        Don't hesitate to create a pull request with your solution, it helps get faster feedback. You should open a pull request on the main symfony-vite-dev monorepo : https://github.com/lhapaipai/symfony-vite-dev.
        This repository is a "subtree split": a read-only subset of that main repository.
